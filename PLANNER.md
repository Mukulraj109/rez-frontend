# Store Action Buttons Component Planner

Based on TASK.md requirements: Add a component above NewSection in StorePage with three buttons (Buy, Lock, Booking) with conditional visibility based on product/service type.

## Project Overview
- **Location**: Above NewSection component in StorePage
- **Component Type**: Action buttons for product/service interactions
- **Conditional Logic**: Show all 3 buttons for services, only Buy & Lock for products
- **Current State**: Products (Booking hidden)
- **Future**: Backend integration for product/service type detection

---

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup
**Objective**: Understand current StorePage structure and prepare for integration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze current StorePage.tsx component structure
- [ ] Locate NewSection component position
- [ ] Review existing button components in the project
- [ ] Identify theme colors and styling patterns
- [ ] Create component directory structure

**Deliverables**:
- Component analysis documentation
- Integration point identified
- Styling guide prepared

---

### Phase 2: Component Architecture Design
**Objective**: Design the StoreActionButtons component interface and logic

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for component props
- [ ] Design conditional rendering logic (product vs service)
- [ ] Plan button states (enabled, disabled, loading)
- [ ] Define component API and props structure
- [ ] Create mock data structure for testing

**Deliverables**:
- TypeScript interfaces
- Component specification document
- Props and state definitions

---

### Phase 3: Core Component Implementation
**Objective**: Build the StoreActionButtons component with basic functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create StoreActionButtons.tsx component file
- [ ] Implement basic component structure with three buttons
- [ ] Add conditional rendering logic for booking button
- [ ] Implement basic styling matching StorePage theme
- [ ] Add button press handlers (console logs for now)

**Deliverables**:
- StoreActionButtons.tsx component
- Basic functionality working
- Conditional rendering implemented

---

### Phase 4: Styling and UI Polish
**Objective**: Create polished, responsive UI that fits StorePage design

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement responsive button layout (horizontal or grid)
- [ ] Add proper spacing, margins, and padding
- [ ] Create button hover/press animations
- [ ] Add icons to buttons (Buy: cart, Lock: lock, Booking: calendar)
- [ ] Ensure consistent theming with existing components
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

**Deliverables**:
- Polished UI design
- Responsive layout
- Consistent theming
- Button animations

---

### Phase 5: Integration with StorePage
**Objective**: Integrate component into StorePage above NewSection

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Import StoreActionButtons into StorePage.tsx
- [ ] Position component above NewSection
- [ ] Pass necessary props (isService/isProduct flag)
- [ ] Test integration doesn't break existing layout
- [ ] Adjust spacing and margins as needed

**Deliverables**:
- Component integrated into StorePage
- Proper positioning above NewSection
- No layout conflicts

---

### Phase 6: State Management and Logic
**Objective**: Implement proper state management and button interactions

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add loading states for button interactions
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add success/failure feedback (alerts/toasts)
- [ ] Create mock API calls for button actions
- [ ] Add button disabled states based on conditions

**Deliverables**:
- State management implemented
- Button interactions working
- Error handling added
- User feedback system

---

### Phase 7: Product/Service Type Logic
**Objective**: Implement the product vs service conditional logic

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create type enum for PRODUCT vs SERVICE
- [ ] Add prop to determine current page type
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering for booking button
- [ ] Test both product and service scenarios
- [ ] Document the conditional logic for future backend integration

**Deliverables**:
- Type system for product/service
- Conditional logic working
- Both scenarios tested
- Documentation for backend integration

---

### Phase 8: Testing and Optimization
**Objective**: Ensure component works correctly and is optimized

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test component in different screen sizes
- [ ] Test all button interactions
- [ ] Verify conditional logic works correctly
- [ ] Check performance and re-render optimization
- [ ] Test integration with existing StorePage functionality

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Performance optimized
- All functionality verified
- Integration tested

---

### Phase 9: Documentation and Future Preparation
**Objective**: Document component and prepare for backend integration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Document props and usage examples
- [ ] Add comments for backend integration points
- [ ] Create type definitions for future API integration
- [ ] Document styling and theming approach

**Deliverables**:
- Component documentation
- Usage examples
- Backend integration guide
- Type definitions for API

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure
```
StoreActionButtons/
├── index.ts (export)
├── StoreActionButtons.tsx (main component)
├── types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
└── styles.ts (styling constants)
```

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface StoreActionButtonsProps {
  storeType: 'PRODUCT' | 'SERVICE';
  onBuyPress: () => void;
  onLockPress: () => void;
  onBookingPress?: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
}
```

### Integration Point
- **File**: `frontend/app/StorePage.tsx`
- **Position**: Above `<NewSection />` component
- **Props**: Pass `storeType: 'PRODUCT'` for current implementation
