# Reorder Modal - Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "refreshCart is not a function" Error - FIXED
**Issue**: Reorder modal crashed with error when clicking "Add to Cart"
**Root Cause**: `useReorder` hook called `refreshCart()` but CartContext didn't export it
**Solution**: Added `refreshCart` as an alias to `loadCart` in CartContext

**Files Modified**:
- `contexts/CartContext.tsx` (Lines 227, 671)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Interface (Line 227)
interface CartContextType {
  state: CartState;
  refreshCart: () => Promise<void>; // ← ADDED: Alias for loadCart
  actions: { ... }
}

// Context Value (Line 671)
const contextValue: CartContextType = {
  state,
  refreshCart: loadCart, // ← ADDED: Alias for loadCart
  actions: { ... }
};
```

---

### 2. ✅ Improved Alert Message - FIXED
**Issue**: Generic "Added to Cart" message
**Solution**: Better formatted alert with item count and clearer options

**Files Modified**:
- `components/orders/ReorderModal.tsx` (Lines 120-147)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
if (success) {
  // Close modal first
  onClose();

  // Wait a bit for modal to close
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));

  // Show success alert
  Alert.alert(
    '✓ Added to Cart',
    `${selectedItems.size} item(s) have been added to your cart`,
    [
      {
        text: 'Continue Shopping',
        onPress: () => {
          onSuccess?.();
        },
        style: 'cancel'
      },
      {
        text: 'View Cart',
        onPress: () => {
          router.push('/CartPage');
        },
        style: 'default'
      }
    ]
  );
}
```

## How to Test (Browser Refresh Required)

Since you're running in the browser (`localhost:8081`), you need to **refresh the browser** to get the new code:

### Steps:
1. In your browser, press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
   - This does a hard refresh and clears cache
2. Or press **F12** to open DevTools, right-click the refresh button, select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Navigate back to Orders → Order Details → Reorder
4. Click "Add to Cart"

### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ No "refreshCart is not a function" error
2. ✅ Modal closes
3. ✅ Alert shows: "✓ Added to Cart - 2 item(s) have been added to your cart"
4. ✅ Two buttons: "Continue Shopping" and "View Cart"
5. ✅ Items are in cart when you check CartPage

## Data Flow

### Old (Broken):
```
ReorderModal
  → useReorder hook
    → calls refreshCart()  ❌ ERROR: not defined
```

### New (Fixed):
```
ReorderModal
  → useReorder hook
    → calls refreshCart()  ✅ Works!
      → CartContext.refreshCart (alias to loadCart)
        → Fetches cart from backend
        → Updates cart state
        → UI updates automatically
```

---

## Why It Failed Before

The `useReorder` hook was trying to destructure `refreshCart` from the CartContext:

```typescript
// hooks/useReorder.ts (Line 47)
const { refreshCart } = useCart();
```

But CartContext only provided `actions.loadCart`:

```typescript
// OLD CartContext
const contextValue = {
  state,
  actions: {
    loadCart,  // ← Only available as actions.loadCart
    ...
  }
};
```

So when `useReorder` called `refreshCart()`, it was `undefined()` → Error!

---

## The Fix

Added `refreshCart` as a direct property on the context:

```typescript
// NEW CartContext
const contextValue = {
  state,
  refreshCart: loadCart,  // ← NOW AVAILABLE directly
  actions: {
    loadCart,
    ...
  }
};
```

Now `useReorder` can call `refreshCart()` successfully!

## Files Modified Summary

1. **`contexts/CartContext.tsx`**
   - Line 227: Added `refreshCart` to interface
   - Line 671: Added `refreshCart` to context value

2. **`components/orders/ReorderModal.tsx`**
   - Lines 120-147: Improved alert with better UX

## Browser Caching Note

**IMPORTANT**: Browser caches JavaScript bundles. Changes to code won't appear until you:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Or clear cache in DevTools
3. Or wait for Metro's hot reload (may not always work for context changes)

If you're still seeing the error after refreshing, check:
1. Browser console for any errors
2. Make sure Metro bundler rebuilt (check terminal for "Building...")
3. Try closing all browser tabs and reopening

**Status**: All fixes applied ✅
**Testing Required**: Browser hard refresh
**Expected Result**: No errors, items added to cart with success message
