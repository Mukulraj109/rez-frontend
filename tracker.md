- **Mock Data**: 7+ comprehensive dummy data files
- **API Layer**: Services folder with API implementations

#### ✅ Component Architecture
- **30+ Components**: Well-organized reusable components
- **Specialized Folders**: onboarding, cart, store-search components
- **Documentation**: Multiple MD files for features

## REVISED Project Scope: Quality Polish Instead of Major Development

### 🎯 New Focus Areas
1. **Page Functionality Testing** - Verify all pages work correctly
2. **Error Handling** - Add missing error boundaries  
3. **Navigation Validation** - Test all routes and flows
4. **User Experience Polish** - Consistent loading states and interactions

### ✅ Work NOT Needed (Already Done Well)
- ❌ ~~Major state management implementation~~ → Excellent hooks exist
- ❌ ~~Type definition creation~~ → Comprehensive types already exist  
- ❌ ~~Backend API preparation~~ → Good foundation with services/types
- ❌ ~~Mock data creation~~ → Extensive dummy data already implemented

## Next Actions (Simplified)

### 🎯 Today's Tasks
1. **Page Audit** - Test each major page functionality
2. **Navigation Testing** - Verify all routes work
3. **Error Detection** - Find and fix any console errors
4. **State Verification** - Ensure existing hooks work properly

### 📊 Expected Timeline: 3-5 Days (Reduced from 12!)
