## 🔧 Utility Systems

### 1. Activity Triggers
**File**: `utils/activityTriggers.ts`

**Purpose**: Automatically create activity feed entries when users perform actions

**11 Trigger Categories**:
1. Order Activities (placed, delivered, cancelled)
2. Cashback Activities (earned, credited)
3. Review Activities (submitted, liked)
4. Video Activities (uploaded, earnings, milestones)
5. Project Activities (completed, payment)
6. Offer Activities (redeemed, expired)
7. Voucher Activities (purchased, redeemed)
8. Referral Activities (sent, joined, bonus)
9. Profile Activities (updated, picture, milestone)
10. Store Activities (favorited, unfavorited, followed)
11. Wallet Activities (recharge, withdrawal, payment)

**Benefits**:
- Silent failures (won't disrupt UX)
- Automatic logging (no manual calls)
- Consistent activity format
- Type-safe

---

### 2. Achievement Triggers
**File**: `utils/achievementTriggers.ts`

**Purpose**: Automatically recalculate achievements and create activity entries for newly unlocked badges

**6 Trigger Categories**:
1. Order Achievements (FIRST_ORDER → ORDER_100)
2. Spending Achievements (SPEND_1K → SPEND_100K)
3. Review Achievements (FIRST_REVIEW → REVIEW_50)
4. Video Achievements (VIDEO_1, VIDEO_10)
5. Referral Achievements (REFERRAL_1 → REFERRAL_10)
6. Profile/Wallet Achievements (PROFILE_COMPLETE, WALLET_LOADED)

**Process**:
1. User performs action
2. Trigger calls `/api/achievements/recalculate`
3. System fetches updated achievements
4. Identifies newly unlocked badges (last 5 min)
5. Creates activity feed entry for each unlock
6. User sees "Milestone Reached" in activity feed

**Benefits**:
- Automatic recalculation
- Activity feed integration
- Silent failures
- Performance throttling (₹100+ for spending, ₹50+ for videos)

---

### 3. Enhanced Service Wrappers
**File**: `utils/activityIntegration.ts`

**Purpose**: Wrap existing API services to automatically trigger activity and achievement logging

**Enhanced Services**:
1. `enhancedOrderService` - Orders with auto-logging
2. `enhancedWalletService` - Wallet ops with auto-logging
3. `enhancedReviewService` - Reviews with auto-logging
4. `enhancedVoucherService` - Vouchers with auto-logging
5. `enhancedOfferService` - Offers with auto-logging
6. `enhancedProfileService` - Profile updates with auto-logging
7. `enhancedStoreService` - Store favorites with auto-logging

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Before: Manual activity creation
await ordersApi.placeOrder(data);
await activityApi.createActivity({ ... });

// After: Automatic activity creation
import { enhancedOrderService } from '@/utils/activityIntegration';
await enhancedOrderService.placeOrder(cartId, addressId, paymentMethodId);
// Activity + achievement check happen automatically!
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well
1. **Custom Hooks Pattern** - Clean separation of logic and UI
2. **Enhanced Services** - Automatic logging without manual calls
3. **Silent Failures** - User experience never disrupted by logging errors
4. **Modal Forms** - Faster UX than full-screen navigation
5. **Accordion Settings** - Organized 30+ settings without overwhelming
6. **Color Coding** - Visual distinction improves UX significantly
7. **Pull-to-Refresh** - Native mobile UX pattern users expect
8. **Pagination** - Prevents loading thousands of activities at once

### Technical Decisions
- **Soft delete for payment methods** - Can be restored if accidentally deleted
- **Hard delete for addresses** - Simpler, addresses can be re-added easily
- **Auto-formatting card numbers** - Better UX, prevents user errors
- **Brand detection** - Visual appeal and quick recognition
- **Throttled triggers** - Prevents excessive API calls for small transactions
- **Activity batching** - Efficient when creating multiple activities

### Best Practices Applied
- **Type Safety** - 100% TypeScript with no `any` types
- **Error Handling** - Try-catch blocks, user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States** - ActivityIndicator on all async operations
- **Empty States** - Helpful messages when no data
- **Confirmation Dialogs** - For destructive actions (delete, reset)
- **Validation** - Form validation before API calls
- **Consistent Design** - Same patterns across all screens
