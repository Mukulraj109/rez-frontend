"Clean lines, neutral tones, and effortless elegance. Minimalism meets modern sophistication."
"Bold patterns and vibrant colors create stunning visual narratives in modern fashion."

// Avoid:
"Check out this amazing look!" // Too short, not descriptive
"This is the most incredible fashion piece you've ever seen in your entire life and you should definitely buy it right now because it's amazing." // Too long, salesy
```
