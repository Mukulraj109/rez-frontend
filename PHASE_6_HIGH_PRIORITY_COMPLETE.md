## 💡 Key Takeaways

### What Works Well
- Hooks make API integration clean and reusable
- Consistent design language across all screens
- Modal forms work better than full-screen forms for quick edits
- Color coding by type improves UX significantly
- Default badges help users identify primary methods quickly

### Best Practices Applied
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Inline editing when possible (nicknames)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Proper error messages
- Loading states on all async operations
- Pull-to-refresh for better UX

### Technical Decisions
- Used modals instead of navigation for forms (faster UX)
- Soft delete for payment methods (can be restored)
- Hard delete for addresses (simpler)
- Auto-formatting for card numbers (better UX)
- Brand detection for cards (visual appeal)
- Type-based color coding (quick recognition)
