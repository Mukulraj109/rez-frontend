    headline: 'Impressive performance with minor compromises',
    content: 'After extensive testing over three weeks, this product has proven to be a solid performer in its category. The build quality exceeds expectations, and the attention to detail in the design is evident. Performance-wise, it handles demanding tasks with ease, though there are some areas where competitors might have an edge. The user experience is generally smooth, with an intuitive interface that makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced users. Battery life is particularly noteworthy, lasting through a full day of heavy use. The price point, while on the higher end, is justified by the premium features and build quality.',
    pros: [
      'Exceptional build quality with premium materials',
      'Outstanding battery life - easily lasts full day',
      'Intuitive and user-friendly interface',
      'Excellent performance for demanding tasks',
    ],
    cons: [
      'Price is higher than some competitors',
      'Camera quality could be improved in low light',
      'No expandable storage option',
    ],
    verdict: 'A well-rounded product that delivers on most fronts. While the premium price tag might give some buyers pause, the combination of build quality, performance, and battery life makes it a worthwhile investment for those seeking reliability and longevity.',

    content: 'Our comprehensive testing protocol revealed a product that excels in several key areas while falling short in others. The performance metrics are consistently above average, particularly in real-world usage scenarios. Durability testing showed impressive resilience, suggesting this product will maintain its quality over extended use. However, the feature set, while comprehensive, lacks some innovative elements found in newer competitors. The value proposition is reasonable considering the overall package, though budget-conscious buyers might find better deals elsewhere.',

    headline: 'Best in class with exceptional value',
    content: 'Rarely does a product exceed expectations across the board, but this one manages to do just that. From the moment you unbox it, the attention to detail is apparent. The packaging itself speaks to the premium nature of the product. In actual use, it performs flawlessly, handling everything we threw at it without breaking a sweat. The feature set is comprehensive and well-implemented, with each function serving a clear purpose rather than being there for marketing bullet points. After comparing it extensively with competitors in the same price range, this stands out as the clear winner. The company has struck an excellent balance between innovation, reliability, and user experience.',

    cons: [
      'Learning curve for advanced features',
      'Premium price point may not fit all budgets',
    ],
    verdict: 'Simply put, this is the best product in its category right now. While the price might stretch some budgets, the combination of features, performance, and build quality make it worth every penny. Highly recommended for anyone seeking the best available option.',

/**
 * Integration Tips:
 *
 * 1. API Integration:
 *    - Replace mock data with API calls using a custom hook
 *    - Example: const { reviews, summary, loading } = useExpertReviews(productId);
 *
 * 2. State Management:
 *    - Store reviews in global state (Redux/Context) for caching
 *    - Implement optimistic updates for helpful votes
 *
 * 3. Performance:
 *    - Lazy load reviews when section becomes visible
 *    - Implement pagination for products with many reviews
 *    - Cache images for faster subsequent loads
 *
 * 4. Analytics:
 *    - Track when users expand reviews
 *    - Monitor helpful vote engagement
 *    - Measure time spent reading reviews
 *
 * 5. Accessibility:
 *    - Ensure all interactive elements have proper accessibility labels
 *    - Test with screen readers
 *    - Implement proper keyboard navigation
