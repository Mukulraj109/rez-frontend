## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Existing)
- React Native with Expo SDK 53.0.20

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with core features before advanced functionality
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use staged rollout for complex features
- Maintain detailed documentation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Complete user authentication system (OTP, JWT, social login, guest access)

- [ ] Real-time notifications and live updates
- [ ] File upload system (profiles, videos, reviews, documents)
- [ ] Search and filtering across all content
- [ ] Wishlist and favorites functionality
- [ ] Complete review and rating system
- [ ] Order management and tracking
- [ ] Help/support system
